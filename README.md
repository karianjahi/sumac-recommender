# sumac-recommender
This application is meant to recommend movies to users on a browser

# Steps:
- Create a repo by your name:
    - make a small description
    - we choose readme file 
    - use python as the gitignore template to ensure that all files and folders which are not to be pushed are ignored without any further user intervention
    - We use MIT License to make sure we are not liable for any problems during usage by other third parties
    - We clone the repo
        `git clone <url of the repo>`
    - We create a virtual environment
        `python -m venv venv`
        - Of course make sure that you have the venv software installed
    - Activate the virtual env
        `source venv/bin/activate`

# Flask application
- The aim is to create a flask app.
- We need to make sure that the flask module is installed
    `pip install flask`
- We want to create a python file where the flask app is to be launched.
    `touch application.py`
